# uriel-numeric
A simple C++ framework for the simulation of computational models.

This project is compatible with Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10. It is also possible to build it and run it on a Linux machine by doing the following:
1. Build the static library projects by running "make" in the uriel-numeric and uriel-tools directories
2. Build the desired application by running "make" in the corresponding directory (e.g. cardiac-cell-solver)
